# REFLECTION QUESTIONS
# =============================================================================
# Answer these questions in comments below:

# 1. What was the most challenging part of this lab?
# Answer: Handling missing values and removing outliers while making sure the statistics were calculated correctly.

# 2. How could soil data analysis help civil engineers in real projects?
# Answer: Soil data analysis helps civil engineers design safe and stable foundations by understanding soil properties and behavior.

# 3. What additional features would make this soil analysis tool more useful?
# Answer: Adding data visualization, automatic outlier detection, and soil classification recommendations would make the tool more useful.

# 4. How did error handling improve the robustness of your code?
# Answer: Error handling made the code more robust by preventing crashes and managing unexpected issues gracefully.
